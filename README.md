# TriviaTime - Python Quiz

This project is a dynamic quiz page that can be integrated into a future website. The page allows users to test their knowledge in various categories by answering multiple-choice questions with a time limit for each. It features a timer, progress bar, and displays results after the quiz ends.

## Requirements

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
- **JSON** (for storing quiz data)

## Implementation

### 1. **Category Selection**
   Users begin by selecting a category for the quiz. Categories are displayed as clickable cards, and once a category is selected, the quiz page loads with questions from that category.

### 2. **Quiz Interaction**
   The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions, each with a 15-second time limit. Users can answer questions by selecting an option, and the page provides immediate feedback on whether the answer was correct or incorrect.

### 3. **Timer Functionality**
   A countdown timer is displayed for each question. When the time runs out, the correct answer is shown, and the page automatically moves to the next question.

### 4. **Navigation**
   Users can navigate between questions using "Next" and "Previous" buttons. These allow the user to review or skip questions.

### 5. **Results Display**
   After the last question is answered or the timer runs out, the user is shown their results, which include the number of correct, incorrect, and skipped answers.

### 6. **Restarting or Exiting**
   After completing the quiz, the user can either restart the quiz or exit back to the category selection screen.
